        <h1>Revolution in safety: The invention of the Street Light</h1>
        <p><strong>Author:</strong> Mathias V. Carcano | <strong>Date: 10/13</strong> Today's Date<br></p>
        <p>In the late 19th century, cities were bustling with activity, yet darkness still reigned after sunset. Enter the electric street light, a groundbreaking invention that transformed urban life and brought a new kind of brightness to the night. As cities became more populated, night crime began to rise tremendously. Building on the foundation laid by the creation of the lightbulb, this new invention revolutionized the world in terms of safety within cities. The design was a significant improvement over the models used at the time, which in major cities like chicago, were mostly gas lamps of the type depicted in figure one, and allowed for a more widespread adoption throughout cities.</p>

        <p>Charles F. Brush, an American inventor, played a key role in the development of electric street lighting. In 1879, Brush’s invention of the first practical electric arc lamp helped make electric street lighting viable, setting the stage for widespread use in cities like New York and Chicago.</p>

        <p>This invention was only possible with the unveiling of Edison’s Lightbulb and was such a significant improvement that only a couple of years after the patent’s commercial release, metropolises like New York and Chicago began swapping their gas lamps for these vibrant, electric alternatives. Crime rates dropped and urban nightlife flourished. It allowed for evening economic activity, as businesses extended their hours, parks became lively gathering spots, and public events thrived after sunset.</p>
